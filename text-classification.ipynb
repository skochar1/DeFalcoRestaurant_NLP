This function `evaluate` takes a model along with texts and labels. It returns the accuracy of the model, which is the number of correct predictions divided by all predictions.\n\nFirst, use the `predict` method you wrote earlier to get the predicted class for each text in `texts`. Then, find where the predicted labels match the true \"gold-standard\" labels and calculate the accuracy.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def evaluate(model, texts, labels):\n    \"\"\" Returns the accuracy of a TextCategorizer model. \n    \n        Arguments\n        ---------\n        model: ScaPy model with a TextCategorizer\n        texts: Text samples, from load_data function\n        labels: True labels, from load_data function\n    \n    \"\"\"\n    # Get predictions from textcat model\n    predicted_class = predict(model, texts)\n\n    # From labels, get the true class as a list of integers (POSITIVE -> 1, NEGATIVE -> 0)\n    true_class = [int(each['cats']['POSITIVE']) for each in labels]\n\n    # A boolean or int array indicating correct predictions\n    correct_predictions = predicted_class == true_class\n\n    # The accuracy, number of correct predictions divided by all predictions\n    accuracy = correct_predictions.mean()\n    \n    return accuracy\n\nstep_5.check()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-13T02:30:48.766618Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-13T02:30:48.766963Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-13T02:30:51.328755Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-13T02:30:48.766932Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-13T02:30:51.327649Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":19,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Javascript object>","application/javascript":"parent.postMessage({\"jupyterEvent\": \"custom.exercise_interaction\", \"data\": {\"outcomeType\": 1, \"valueTowardsCompletion\": 0.16666666666666666, \"interactionType\": 1, \"questionType\": 2, \"questionId\": \"5_EvaluateFunction\", \"learnToolsVersion\": \"0.3.4\", \"failureMessage\": \"\", \"exceptionClass\": \"\", \"trace\": \"\"}}, \"*\")"},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Correct","text/markdown":"<span style=\"color:#33cc33\">Correct</span>"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Lines below will give you a hint or solution code\n#step_5.hint()\n#step_5.solution()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-13T02:30:55.134370Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-13T02:30:55.134731Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-13T02:30:55.138764Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-13T02:30:55.134699Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-13T02:30:55.137589Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":20,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"accuracy = evaluate(nlp, val_texts, val_labels)\nprint(f\"Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-13T02:30:58.583595Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-13T02:30:58.583918Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-13T02:31:00.534839Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-13T02:30:58.583890Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-13T02:31:00.533708Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":21,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Accuracy: 0.9481\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"With the functions implemented, you can train and evaluate in a loop.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This may take a while to run!\nn_iters = 5\nfor i in range(n_iters):\n    losses = train(nlp, train_data, optimizer)\n    accuracy = evaluate(nlp, val_texts, val_labels)\n    print(f\"Loss: {losses['textcat']:.3f} \\t Accuracy: {accuracy:.3f}\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-13T02:31:05.668161Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-13T02:31:05.668529Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-13T02:40:45.867311Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-13T02:31:05.668490Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-13T02:40:45.866343Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":22,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Loss: 4.063 \t Accuracy: 0.944\nLoss: 2.879 \t Accuracy: 0.945\nLoss: 2.219 \t Accuracy: 0.943\nLoss: 1.821 \t Accuracy: 0.944\nLoss: 1.511 \t Accuracy: 0.942\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Step 6: Keep Improving\n\nYou've built the necessary components to train a text classifier with spaCy.
